## Election Summary
This script can be used for any election. For one instance, if one wanted to change the scale of the election, United States presidential elections for example, 
you could change the script to read states instead of counties, and count votes from states, provided you have a csv file with that information. This can happen in a second way,
in the other direction too. If one wanted to analyze a much smaller election, such as a mayor or a city council, one can change the script to read and count the votes from
each respective voting precint. This information is often harder to come across, though the script would work equally well if the information is available.
